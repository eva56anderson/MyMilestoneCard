# MyMilestoneCard Login

## üìå Description

MyMilestoneCard Login is a responsive and user-friendly React-based web application designed to streamline access to Milestone credit card account management. With a clean user interface and secure login functionalities, users can easily view account details, track expenses, view receipts, and manage transactions seamlessly. The project is structured to help developers understand component-based architecture using modern React practices such as hooks and props. It is ideal for users wanting to simulate a credit account login experience or for developers learning front-end form handling and state management.

This project is fully open-source and aims to serve both educational and practical purposes. Contributions are welcome, and we encourage developers to improve features or customize the interface for their own use cases.
